	<skill name="Move Quietly" bonus="Stealth" beginning="10" description="This is the ability to walk, run, crawl, swim, jump, etc., as quietly as possible. On a successful roll, an opponent will be surprised. Wood or metal armor reduces one's ability to Move Quietly (it tends to clink and jingle.) If wearing barbarian or plate armor, subtract 40% from your skill percentage before making the skill roll."/>
	<skill name="Hide" bonus="Stealth" beginning="10" description="Unless one has the ability to be invisible, one cannot hide without cover. 'Cover' may be almost anything: boulders, brush, trees, a field full of corpses, etc. If one makes the roll, the hidden person will remain undetected by searchers unless they come within a yard (one meter) of the hidden person or make a successful see roll within 10 yards (10 meters.)\n\nIf the character tries to move while staying hidden in cover, roll again at half the normal skill roll."/>
	<skill name="Ambush" bonus="Stealth" beginning="bonus" description="This is the skill of hiding one's intent to attack another.\n\nA successful roll on one's Ambush skill means the character will probably get the advantage of surprise in the first combat rounds."/>
	<skill name="Conceal" bonus="Stealth" beginning="bonus" description="A successful roll allows one to secretly pocket or conceal any small item (less than a foot long in any direction) without anyone noticing. Furthermore, a successful roll will allow one to hide an object in bushes, furniture, rocks, etc., so well that only the hider or someone successfully using a Search skill will be able to recover it."/>
	<skill name="Cut Purse" bonus="Stealth" beginning="bonus" description="This includes common pocket picking as well as the ability to cut purses, and also covers the theft of jewelry such as brooches or pins. Items in direct contact with the skin, such as rings, armbands, etc., force the operation of the ability at half the regular skill level. In addition, when trying to take an object from direct contact with the skin of a being who is awake and alive, the thief must make his saving roll against his Dexterity."/>
	<skill name="Ride" bonus="Agility" beginning="bonus" description="While anyone can sit on a horse as it walks along quietly, the ability to ride a steed when it is bucking, galloping, or otherwise acting-up requires much skill. The Ride skill roll must be made whenever a character tries to fight from horseback( once for each combat round), or when the horse is trying to throw the rider, or if the horse gallops (one successful roll indicates the rider can keep his/her seat.) The Ride skill includes being able to saddle an animal with unfamiliar gear, knowing what to feed it, and how to care for it. The GM may require a Ride roll from any character using a steed on general principles; if the roll is missed, the GM is justified in having the animal bite or step on the person.\n\nPlayers who fail their Ride skill roll during a dangerous situation (galloping, bucking, combat, etc.) should definitely be unseated and tumbled off the horse. In case of a fumble roll, the characters not only fall off the horse but takes 1d10 damage from the fall.\n\nAny character fighting from horseback will fight at the lesser of his Ride or his normal weapon ability."/>
	<skill name="Swim" bonus="Agility" beginning="bonus" description="Whenever a character must do more in the water than flounder ashore, a Swim roll will be required. Characters ahve three chances to make their Swim roll - if they fail all three they drown unless some sort of rescue action is taken by another character. Missing the first or second roll takes 1 point away from the character's Hit Point total because of water in the lungs. Swim rolls must be made every 15 minutes the character is in the water.\n\nSwim includes such things as swimming underwater while holding one's breath, diving from a height more than 5 feet, and treading water. To swim while rescuing or towing another person requires two successful Swim rolls back-to-back.\n\nA drowning character, who has missed all three Swim rolls, will take 1D8 points of damage per melee round until he is dead. A rescued drowning character can have these points restored by a successful First Aid roll."/>
	<skill name="Climb" bonus="Agility" beginning="10" description="Climb includes the ability to scale walls, cliffs, trees, building faces, etc. The GM may require the use of a rope for especially difficult climbs, in which case the Climb skill includes the ability to climb a rope. Sheer walls may be climbed by using artificial devices such as piton or suction cups for hand and feet; but, the climber must roll against half his/her Climb skill.\n\nIf the Climb roll is missed, the climber will fall sometime during the climb. GM should roll 1D100 to determine how far the character fell. The faller takes 1D6 of damage for each 10 feet (3 meters) fallen - ignore fraction. For example, a fall of 28 feet would cause he character to roll 2D6 to determine how much damage was taken. If the indicated height falled is greater than the distance to be climbed, the character will fall the maximum distance possible. On a roll of 00 the GM will add 100 and roll again for total distance fallen.\n\nFor silent climbing, the GM will multiply the character's Move Quietly ability times it Climb ability. The character will be concentrating primarily on climbing, so if the die roll is between the value needed for climbing silently and the value for just climbing, the character could make the climb but would make noise doing it, losing the advantage of surprise."/>
	<skill name="Climb Rigging" bonus="Agility" beginning="10" description="This is the ability to climb the ropes of ships and similar activities. The Climb Rigging skill is otherwise similar to the Climb skill in every respect."/>
	<skill name="Jump" bonus="Agility" beginning="10" description="Jump refers generally to unusual situations such as jumping from roof to roof or acroos chasms, or hurdling a fallen body during a melee. Generally speaking, a character may clear three times its own height in a horizontal jump or its own height in a vertical distance. Missing the Jump roll indicates that the distance was not cleared with whatever logical results that entails.\n\nSubtract 4 feed from horizontal and vertical jump distance for a character wearing armor. Add 1 foot of horizontal distance that the character can cover for each STR point over 15."/>
	<skill name="Tumble" bonus="Agility" beginning="bonus" description="'Tumble' is jumping and faling under perfect control. A falling character must use his Tumble skill to break his fall, to avoid taking damage in falls of less than 30 feet (9 meters.) Tumble does not help in longer falls.\n\nIt is also the skill used for such things as a dive and roll in combat. A successful use of the skill means that the character may move away from his attackers up to 1/4th his normal move and they must subtract his Tumble ability from their normal Attack percentage to hit him."/>
	<skill name="Dodge" bonus="Agility" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to avoid moving objects. If a character is not hemmed in by walls or other close quarters, he may Dodge to avoid a melee weapon, rather than Attack and Parry that round. More likely the skill will be used against a thrown object. One can Dodge a spear or rock; one cannot Dodge an arrow. If Dodging a sequence of objects during a melee round, the ability goes down by 20% for each object Dodged."/>
	<skill name="Tie/Untie Knot" bonus="Manipulation" beginning="bonus" description="The ability to create a complex know in a short period of time (under 3 minutes) requires a skill roll; so does untying a complex knot. If the roll is missed, the knot is badly tied and will not function properly. Sailors with this skill may safely manipulate sailing tackle without fouling lines and sails."/>
	<skill name="Set/Disarm Trap" bonus="Manipulation" beginning="bonus" description="A successful roll is required to Set or Disarm a trap that will function as described by the setter. If the roll is missed while being set, the trap will look good; but, will not work. If the roll is missed while disarming a trap, the trap will spring unexpectedly and catch the person attempting to disarm it."/>
	<skill name="Slight of Hand" bonus="Manipulation" beginning="bonus" description="This skill requires a minimum DEX of 15 or it will not be allowed. It refers to the old adage that the hand is quicker than the eye, and deals with all those aspects of magic generally known as conjuring. Pulling eggs out of ears, rabbits out of hats, and all other forms of stage magic come under this subject heading. When attempting the Slight of Hand roll, a miss indicates that the viewer was not fooled, and saw what the character did. A fumble roll of 00 indicates that the character dropped whatever he/she was trying to manipulate. Chaacters may use flash powders and misdirection to accomplish the slight of hand if such techniques are required by the logic of the situation. The only way to detect a successful use of Slight of Hand is when a character suspects its use and makes a successful roll on his own Slight of Hand ability.">

	<skill name="Juggle" bonus="Manipulation" beginning="bonus" description="Juglle is a skill generally reserved for performers, and consists of the knack of keeping two or more objects continuously spinning in the air. It requires a minimum DEX of 13. For each 10% in Juggle skill, the player may keep another object in motion. A missed Juggle roll indicates that the objects in motion fave fallen. A juggler adds half his Juggle skill to his skill with any thrown weapon.">

	</skill>
	<skill name="Pick Lock" bonus="Manipulation" beginning="bonus" description="A successful roll allows the character to use a picklock or other small piece of metal to unlock any device normally locked by a key. Locks in the Young Kingdoms were generally crude, and the combination lock does not exist."/>
	<skill name="See" bonus="Perception" beginning="10" description="This allows the character to visually notice normally unnoticeable items. It can be used to determine whether a character is wearing armor under his clothes or if someone is hiding behind an arras, to pick out details of dress or irregularities in the floor, etc. It can also be used to pick out ditails at a distance.\n\nThis skill can be used to seek out secret doors, although the later Search skill will be necessary to find concealed items such as the latch for the secret door."/>
	<skill name="Listen" bonus="Perception" beginning="10" description="This is just waht it sounds like and permits the character to hear sounds that might not otherwise be apparent. Since most of the Young Kengdoms speak a common speech, it is generally not necessary to try to identify languages. It is usually either the Common Tongue or Melnibonean when civilized men are speaking."/>
	<skill name="Scent" bonus="Perception" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to identify a substance, beast or other being by its odor. Animals such as dogs have the highest skill at this; but, trained humans can be quite good. The ability is reduced by half if the user is under the influence of alcohol, other drugs, or is in close proximity to a burning flame or overpower odor."/>
	<skill name="Taste" bonus="Perception" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to identify the composition of a substance by a very small taste. It is useful in determining whether a food is poisoned or not, and has other uses, such as identifying ambiguous substances. Of course, if the character uses it to identify a poison, the character may already be poisoned; but, by tasting only a small portion the character earns the right to roll his CON x 5% to see if it had any effect or not. If the poison saving roll is missed against a deadly poison, the character subtracts his CON x 5 from the number actually rolled and takes that many Hit Points in damage from the poison instead. Against a non-deadly poison, the character takes half the effects in oints, length or unconsciousness, etc.\n\nCharacters may also use this ability to 'taste' metals and identify the metal or alloy; but, at only half their normal rating."/>
	<skill name="Balance" bonus="Perception" beginning="10" description="Balance is the perception of the balance point of the character's body or any other object. In situations where there is a good chance of falling, such as the character walking along a narrow ledge, the GM should call for a Balance roll from the player. The Balance check should also be made if the character is constructing some elaborate stack of objects such as coins, furniture, weapons, etc. This skill also allows the character to determine whther an area slopes, and in what direction(s) if so."/>
	<skill name="Search" bonus="Perception" beginning="bonus" description="This is the skill of finding hidden objects by a diligent, hands-on examination of an area. If a secret door is found with the See ability, the Search is necessary to find the activating latch. If a room is to be ransacked, the Search skill is used. If a body is to be looted, use the Search ability. If using Search for a trap, and the roll is failed, the searcher will probably be causght in the trap."/>
	<skill name="Track" bonus="Perception" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to trail a living being by means of the traces it leaves behind such as footprints, droppings, disturbed vegetation, etc. It includes such things as knokwledge of how certain animals behave when trying to elude pursuers. When the quarry creature has been wounded, the tracker's Track ability increases by 20%.\n\nThe Track roll must be made every 10 minutes of game time. If the trail is lost, the tracker may cast about to see if he/she can pick up the trail again at a different point. This cast about roll is made against half the Track skill.\n\nA trail should be considered recent if it was made anytime during the past day or night period. However, if a trail is more than 24 hours old, it will deteriorate and be correspondingly harder to follow. For each day or fraction of a day over the first 24 hour period when the trail is fresh, subtract 20% from the character's Track skill."/>

First Aid includes such things as staunching the flow of blood, applying a tourniquet or splint, setting a broken bone, bandaging, performing artificial respiration, etc.\n\nA successful First Aid roll in a gaming situation means that the injured character has been successfully treated, and therefore the character will not lose any more Hit Points because of delayed effects of the injury, regains 1D3 Hit Points, and, if given enough time, will eventually recover. Characters who suffer a major wound or critical hit will usually need to have some other character successfully perform Fird Aid in order to avoid dying from the serious after-effects of the wound.\n\nA missed roll indicates that instead of helping, the methods tried were ineffectual. A seriously injured character is likely to die unless some other character attempts to heal him. A character with only minor injuries isn't hurt so badly if the First Aid roll fails - he would have recovered anyway. A fumble on a First Air roll indicates that the would-be doctor actually causes additional harm with her/her misguided efforts at medicine. The injured character takes half again as many hits as already suffered.\n\nA critical hit on a First Aid roll will either heal 1D3+3 Hit Points or prevent the long-term results of a major or critical wound.\n\nCharacter who have the skill and are still conscious may attempt to heal themselves after taking an injury. Regardless of who does the First Aid, that character will only get one attempt to do the job correctly. If one has five wounded characters and only one character with a First Aid skill, one would only get a single attempt to heal each of the five injured characters.

However, if the roll is made the GM must dutifully answer all directional questions about the area mapped."/>
	<skill name="Memorize" bonus="Knowledge" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to recall things: words, conversations, messages, maps, etc., perfectly. In effect, the GM becomes the character's memory so long as the Memorize roll is successfully made. If the Memorize roll is failed, the GM should onl state that the character has a mental block and can't remember at that time. Memory rolls may only be made once every game hour."/>
	<skill name="Poison Lore" bonus="Knowledge" beginning="0" description="There are thousands of different poisons producing all manners of effects, from simple nausea to instant death. There are chemical poisons, poisonous foods, and venomous poisons extracted from the poison sacs of various snakes, spiders, and sea-creatures. When a character obtains a poison, he should try to do so from a Poison Master, who can guarantee that the poison will have the desired effect.\n\nThe person knowing poisons has the ability to concoct poisons by their appearance or odor, to know the antidote for various poisons. People skilled in Poison Lore may be able to so immunize themselves in advance against certain poisons that they could drink a glass of poisoned wine without any effect while another person drinking it would die.\n\nPoison Lore cannot be gained by experience - it must be taught. After a successful poisoning, do not roll against your skill percentage to see if you improve. Characters keep the same Poison Lore rating they start with unless they meet someone who can teach them more. Such learning encounters may be set up by the GM using a non-player character, or additional knowledge of Poison Lore could be gained from a Demon of Knowledge. Other ways to improve including finding a grimoire of poisons, or ot learn from another player-character. Player-characters who knokw Poison Lore are unlikely to know exactly the same poisons although they will undoubtedly know many in common. Therefore, when two characters knowing Poison Lore encounter each other for the first time, they may exchange knowledge if they sit and talk for an hour or more of game time. To do so they should each roll 1D10-1 to get a range from 0 to 9. A roll of 0 means the player gains no new knowledge, while a 9% increase is the most a character can hope for. The two cannot learn anything further from each other until they have each learned from another source.\n\nMaster of Poison Lore may get a skill eprcentage as high as 200% because of the peculiarities of learning antidotes. No matter how high the Poison Lore skill, a roll of 00 is always a fumble and means the character does not know that particular poioson.\n\nMasters of Poison Lore are also Masters of Antidotes; however, antidotes are much harder to learn and to produce on demand. Therefore, when rolling to see if a character knows or can produce any particular antidote, roll against half the character's Poison Lore skill.">

	<skill name="Music Lore" bonus="Knowledge" beginning="0" description="Music Lore includes knowledge of songs and singing styles and playing a musical instrument. It may include such things as chanting, singing in harmony or reciting poetry.\n\nFor each 10% of skill in Music Lore, the character may learn another musical instrument.\n\nCharacters wishing to use their Sing skill must have Music Lore to match their Sing ability if they are to meet every demand made of them from an audience.\n\nMusic Lore may not be improvved by practice. Making a Music Lore skill roll does not entitle the character to see if the Music Lore skill is improved. It may only be increased by training, etiher in a situation set up by the GM or by encountering another character with a Music Lore skill. When that happens, the character with the lower skill rating may roll 1D6 to see how much he can learn from the other bard, while the character with the higher skill rating may roll 1D4 to see how much he can learn. In order to learn anything, the two must be in each other's company for at least one game day.\n\nCharacters with skill in Music Lore also have a better than average command of the legends and folklore of their world. Characters who ask for a chance to make their Music Lore rolls during an adventure and then amange to roll half or less of the needed roll will remember a legend pertinent to the situation - even if the GM has to make  up said legend on the spot.">

	<skill name="Persuade" bonus="Communication" beginning="10" description="This is the ability to win arguments, to bring others over to your point of view. Subtract 10 points from your skill level if you are trying to persuade a character of the opposite alignment. The Persuade skill assumes that the characters can address each other in a common language and that the persuader isn't trying to get the ther person to do something blatantly stupid. If two characers with the same skill try to persuade each other, the one who makes the lowest skill roll and success will win the argument.\n\nA roll of 00 is always a fumble, and indicates that the character has been persuaded of the exact opposite and may react in a hostile manner if appropriate."/>
	<skill name="Credit" bonus="Communication" beginning="bonus" description="When a character is first created, this skill, if he has it, will determine how much additional cash the character may start with. First roll the character's Credit ability. If the roll is made, roll 1D6 and 1D100. On a d6 roll of 1-5, multiply the 1D100 roll by 5 to determine how many Large Bronze pieces the character has. If the d6 roll is 6, multiply by 10.\n\nAfter a character has been established for some time, he or she may want to take a loan. Any reasonable amount of money may be loaned or borrowed, and the collateral may be arranged normally; but, before the loan can be granted the borrow must roll against his Credit skill. If the roll is successful, the loan will be granted. If the orll is missed, the lender will change his mind. Loans cannot be asked for more than once per game week from the same lender and no more than five loan applications may be made in any given city.\n\nThe Credit skill may be used for panhandling for money that the character never intends to give back. This is begging pure and simple, and the character should nevver net more than 1D20 Large Bronze coins from it at any one time."/>
	<skill name="Orate" bonus="Communication" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to sway crowds by one's voice - delivering an impassioned speech that rouses the emotions of many people. It can be highly effective; but, the speaker must also be a leader and take the lead in any subsequent actions. Oratory may also be used to good effect on such aggregates as a city council, a posse, a group of cut-throuts, etc.\n\nThe skill of Orate may never get better than 99%. A roll of 00 is always a fumble, and it makes the listeners so angry that they will probably attack the speaker."/>
	<skill name="Sing" bonus="Communication" beginning="bonus" description="This is the ability to 'sell' a song or story told to music, as well as any intrumental accompaniment. The character must know Music Lore in order to have songs to perform; but, this is the skill of getting paid for it.\n\nPlayers may try to earn a living by means of their Sing skill. When the skill roll is made on 1D100, he or she has perfomed well and the surrounding crowd, if there is one, will throw money to the value of 1D100 Large Bronze pieces. If the skill roll is critical, the crowd will throw the equivalent of 1D100x5 Large Bronze pieces. Entertaining heads of state or other important personages will involve similar raises in pay.\n\nMasimum Sing ability is 99%. A roll of 00 is always a fumble - it means that for some reason your character sounds like a rusty hinge or a gallows crow and nobody wants to listen. People may be angered and attack a character who fumbles a Sing skill roll. They expected better."/>
